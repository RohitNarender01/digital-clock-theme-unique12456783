# Live Digital Clock Webpage

## Overview

This project is a simple webpage that displays a real-time digital clock with hours, minutes, and seconds. It also includes functionality for toggling between a light and dark theme, enhancing user experience under different lighting conditions.

## Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-digital-clock.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd live-digital-clock
   ```

3. **Open the Webpage:**

   Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the live digital clock.

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

   Alternatively, you can drag and drop the `index.html` file into a browser window.

## Usage

Once the webpage is open in your browser, it will automatically display the current time with hours, minutes, and seconds. The time updates live every second. 

To switch between light and dark themes, click the "Toggle Theme" button located on the webpage. This provides a better viewing experience based on your preferences or the ambient lighting.

## Code Explanation

The functionality of this digital clock webpage is encapsulated in the following files:

- **index.html**: This is the core HTML file comprising the structure of the webpage. 
    - It includes a `<div>` for displaying the digital clock.
    - A "Toggle Theme" button is also part of this file, which triggers the theme switching functionality.
    - Minimal inline JavaScript is included to handle the ticking of the clock and the theme toggle logic.

  Here's a brief breakdown of how the components are structured:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>Live Digital Clock</title>
      <style>
          /* Add your CSS styles here */
          /* Styles for light and dark themes */
      </style>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="clock"></div>
      <button id="toggle-theme">Toggle Theme</button>
      <script>
          // JavaScript for updating the clock and toggling themes
      </script>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

- **JavaScript code**: Embedded within the `index.html` in a `<script>` tag, the JavaScript code performs the following tasks:
  - Updates the time displayed on the webpage every second using the `setInterval()` function.
  - Switches between light and dark themes by toggling CSS class names upon button-click events.
